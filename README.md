# Data Science vs. Pump It Up Competition

Tanzania is the largest country in East Africa within the African Great Lakes region, with a population of 59 millions people. Like many poor nations around the world, Tanzania suffers from serious issues involving not having access to clean water. The Tanzanian Water Ministry agreed with Taarifa and they began a competition by DrivenData to solve this problem by improving clean water sources. This project involved using information given about water-points in Tanzania to predict whether or not a given water source (wells, pumps, standpipes, fountains, boreholes, etc.) was working correctly.

There are 3 different datasets: training set, test set and train labels set which contains the status of wells. 

* The given data included a target with three classes — ‘functioning’, ‘non-functioning’, and ‘functioning needs repair’. 
* The train & test set contain 59400 water points data with 40 features.

The idea was to build a model that could predict if a given water-point would fall into one of these three classes.
